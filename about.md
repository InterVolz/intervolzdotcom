## ABOUT

Hello, I'm Maxwell, a 34 year old software engineer living in San Francisco.

I am passionate about computers. Currently, I automate various systems from bare metal to graphical dashboards using Python, and for fun I also like to write Python and JavaScript to make various systems and create.

InterVolz is a place to formalize the rather unorganized way I have been working on projects the past decade.
