## ABOUT

Hello, I am Maxwell, a 34 year old software engineer living in San Francisco.

I am passionate about computers. Currently, for work, I automate various systems from bare metal to graphical dashboards using Python. I also like to write Python and JavaScript for fun! I love making things.

InterVolz is a place to formalize the rather unorganized way I have been working on projects the past decade.
